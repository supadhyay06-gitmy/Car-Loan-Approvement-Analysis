Car Loan Approvement Analysis and RCA*

Objective: To understand the Lead to Disbursal Funnel.

Data Explanation:

Attached file contains 4 columns:
User_id- Unique customer id
Risk Bucket - Ranking of user profile ( A being best , E being worst)
Rate_of_interest - Pitched rate of interest for the loan
Cibil_Bucket - Higher the cibil score less risky is the user
Car Selling Price - Price of the car that the user is interested to buy
Disbursable Loan Amount - How much of the car's value can be given as loan to the user
An ideal conversion funnel is : Login -> Credit_approved -> Agreement Created -> Disbursed 

Sharing some context to help you understand our business better:
A customer at the credit approved stage is pitched loan terms - Eg. ROI , Disbursable Loan amount (calculated based on the car price)
The loan terms are based on the customer's credit quality - Like risk bucket, Cibil Buckets

Based on above dataset following questions need to answer

Questions: 

We'd like you to analyse the month on month conversion funnel. 
Additionally, please analyze the conversion funnel of July against the previous months and share your insights on the changes observed.

You are expected to share an RCA (data driven) of why the July conversion could have possibly increased or decreased as compared to previous months.
